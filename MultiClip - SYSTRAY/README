Currently non-operational.

Intended to run within the system tray, look at a given folder and created a nested menu context menu when clicking.
Nested menu will show all folders/files within the parent directory, selecting a folder will open a new nested menu for that folder.
Selecting a file will copy the file contents to the clipboard.

At present, the file can create a system tray icon, with a context menu, and create items of a single given directory.

Currently unable to have the program search through subfolders and create relevant entries.
