## Multiclip Tools

#### Multiclip - CmdLine

A command line program for copying file contents to clipboard.

On initial launch the program creates a config file, and prompts the user to enter their settings.
Able to navigate between directories within the user specified 'home' folder, able to copy contents of txt files to clipboard.


#### MultiClip - SysTray

Currently non-operational.

Intended to run within the system tray -

- Looks at a given folder and creats a nested menu context menu when clicking.
- Nested menu will show all folders/files within the parent directory.
- Selecting a folder will open a new nested menu for that folder.
- Selecting a file will copy the file contents to the clipboard.

At present, the file can create a system tray icon, with a context menu, and create items of a single given directory.

Currently unable to have the program search through subfolders and create relevant entries.
