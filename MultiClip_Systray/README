A system tray application that creates a nested menu of the given directory, able to copy txt file contents to clipboard.

- Looks at a given folder and creates a nested context menu on right-click.
- Nested menu shows all folders/files within the parent directory.
- Selecting a folder opens a new nested menu for that folder.
- Selecting a file copies the file contents to the clipboard.

Above functions are currently working.

Still need to implement a configuration step, so that on first launch if unable to find a config file it will prompt user to enter
their MultiClip directory.
