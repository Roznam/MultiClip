A system tray application that creates a nested menu of the given directory, able to copy txt file contents to clipboard.

- On first launch prompts user via cmd for configuration settings: the location of the MultiClip directory, and system tray icon location.
- Creates a system tray icon with a nested menu display on right-click.
- The nested menu shows all folders/files within the MultiClip directory.
- Selecting a folder opens a new nested menu for that folder.
- Selecting a file copies the file contents to the clipboard.

Current issues:
- Command prompt window displays regardless of whether input is needed from user for the config file
-- Possibly implement PyQt dialog input box as these would then close after input
- Context menu displays files that it is unable to handle (non-.txt files)
